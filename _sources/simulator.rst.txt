The Simulator Interface
***********************

Stingray comes with a range of capabilities for simulating spectral-timing 
data sets, implemented in the subpackage ``stingray.simulator``. Here, 
we provide a range of tutorials showing examples of how one may simulate time 
series as well as spectral timing data.
